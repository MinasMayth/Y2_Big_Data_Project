This has resulted in significant delays in the distribution of residential heating fuels, especially propane,” Governor Parson said. “In order to meet this need and protect the well-being of Missourians, we must ensure that our truck drivers have enough time to distribute heating fuel to homes and businesses across the state.” Current federal and state regulations limit the number of hours commercial truck drivers can operate to 11 consecutive hours. Executive Order 21-03 temporarily suspends these regulations for motor carriers transporting heating fuel such as propane, natural gas, and heating oil. No other petroleum products or fuels are covered under the order. To date, 14 other states have taken similar action to temporarily waive or relax maximum driving hours associated with the transportation of residential heating fuels.

COVID-19’s economic impacts have created hard times for many Missourians, and we are happy to provide this immediate relief,” Governor Parson said. “I applaud the work of the General Assembly, House Budget Chair Cody Smith, and Senate Appropriations Chair Dan Hegeman for their work in getting this legislation across the finish line for the people of Missouri.” The ERAP was passed by Congress in December 2020. The program's passage made funding available to state and local governments to assist households that are unable to pay rent and utilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The program includes up to 12 months of assistance for rental arrears, forward rental assistance, utility arrears, and utility forward assistance. Utility assistance includes electricity, gas, water and sewer, trash removal, and certain energy costs. Both landlords and tenants are eligible to apply for assistance through the program. More information regarding the Emergency Rental Assistance Program can be found on the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s website.

As is standard protocol for any death reported in VAERS it will be fully reviewed.
