# Y2_Big_Data_Project
COVID-19 Neural Network ML project for 2nd year LAS studies.

To do:
 - We need a list of features we want to use in the model (Amin has recommended No. of tests as one)
 
 
 List of features:
- Number of tests
- Population density
- Population demography (e.g. (mean) age)
- Airport (and road) traffic  (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0241165)
- Inter-zone mobility
- Restrictions put in place?/lockdown?
- Climate and/or weather conditions (Most of the studies show that increasing solar radiation, temperature and humidity should reduce the spreading of the pandemic, but several studies find that the epidemic intensity might not fully attenuate in summer in the middle latitudes or in sub-tropical and tropical climates. - https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/science-update/do-environmental-factors-influence-covid-19-outbreaks) 
- Geographic location (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20479700.2020.1755804)
- Culture (e.g. In some cultures, older people socialise a lot, whereas in others, they spend much of their time alone - https://theconversation.com/six-unknown-factors-in-coronavirus-models-and-how-they-could-affect-predictions-134855)
- Air pollution (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319562X20306331#s0055)
